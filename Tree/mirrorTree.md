To create a mirror of a binary tree, the goal is to swap the left and right children of every node in the tree. Here’s how you can approach the problem:

### Intuition:
A **mirror tree** is formed by reversing the structure of the binary tree. For each node:
1. Swap the left and right subtrees.
2. Recursively mirror the left and right subtrees.

For example, in your provided tree:
```
      1
    /   \
    3     2
        / \
        5   4
```
The mirror tree would be:
```
        1
      /   \
      2     3
    / \
    4   5
```

### Recursive Approach (DFS):
1. Base case: If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
2. Swap the left and right children of the current node.
3. Recursively call the mirror function on the left and right children.

#### Java Code:
```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class MirrorTree {
    // Recursive approach to create mirror
    public TreeNode mirrorTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        // Swap the left and right children
        TreeNode temp = root.left;
        root.left = root.right;
        root.right = temp;

        // Recursively call for left and right subtrees
        mirrorTree(root.left);
        mirrorTree(root.right);

        return root;
    }
}
```

### Iterative Approach (BFS or DFS with stack):
1. You can also use a **queue** (BFS) or a **stack** (DFS) to traverse the tree and perform the swap iteratively at each node.

#### Iterative Java Code (BFS):
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class MirrorTreeIterative {
    public TreeNode mirrorTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();

            // Swap left and right children
            TreeNode temp = current.left;
            current.left = current.right;
            current.right = temp;

            // Add children to the queue if they exist
            if (current.left != null) {
                queue.add(current.left);
            }
            if (current.right != null) {
                queue.add(current.right);
            }
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Recursive Approach:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited once to perform the swap and recursive calls.
- **Iterative Approach:** O(n), for the same reason—each node is processed once in the queue or stack.

### Space Complexity:
- **Recursive Approach:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height can be O(n).
- **Iterative Approach (BFS or DFS):** O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (which is the most number of nodes at any level). In the worst case, the space complexity will be O(n) if the tree is completely balanced.

Both recursive and iterative methods are efficient for solving this problem. Let me know if you'd like more details!

### Dry Run
Let’s do a dry run of the provided recursive `mirrorTree` method using the tree in the image you shared:

Original Tree:
```
     1
   /   \
  3     2
       / \
      5   4
```
------------------

----------
### Dry Run DFS recursive approch

1. **Initial Call:**
   - `mirrorTree(root)` where `root = 1`
   - Current node: `1`
     - Left child: `3`
     - Right child: `2`
   
2. **Step 1: Swap the children of node `1`**
   - `temp = root.left` (which is `3`)
   - Swap:
     - `root.left = root.right` → `root.left = 2`
     - `root.right = temp` → `root.right = 3`
   - After swapping, the tree looks like:
   ```
          1
        /   \
        2     3
      / \
      5   4
   ```

3. **Step 2: Recursively mirror the left subtree of node `1` (now root.left = `2`)**
   - `mirrorTree(root.left)` where `root.left = 2`
   - Current node: `2`
     - Left child: `5`
     - Right child: `4`

4. **Step 3: Swap the children of node `2`**
   - `temp = root.left` (which is `5`)
   - Swap:
     - `root.left = root.right` → `root.left = 4`
     - `root.right = temp` → `root.right = 5`
   - After swapping, the tree looks like:
   ```
          1
        /   \
        2     3
      / \
      4   5
   ```

5. **Step 4: Recursively mirror the left subtree of node `2` (now root.left = `4`)**
   - `mirrorTree(root.left)` where `root.left = 4`
   - Current node: `4`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)
   - Base case: `root == null`, so return `null`.

6. **Step 5: Recursively mirror the right subtree of node `2` (now root.right = `5`)**
   - `mirrorTree(root.right)` where `root.right = 5`
   - Current node: `5`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)
   - Base case: `root == null`, so return `null`.

7. **Step 6: Backtrack to node `1` and mirror the right subtree of node `1` (now root.right = `3`)**
   - `mirrorTree(root.right)` where `root.right = 3`
   - Current node: `3`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)
   - Base case: `root == null`, so return `null`.

### Final Tree Structure (Mirrored):
```
        1
      /   \
      2     3
    / \
    4   5
```

### Summary of Recursion:
- Start at the root (node `1`), swap the children.
- Move recursively to the left and right subtrees, performing swaps until all nodes have been processed.
  
This is how the algorithm works, swapping nodes at each level recursively to form the mirror image of the binary tree.


Let’s do a dry run of the iterative approach using a **queue**. Here's the initial tree you provided:

Original Tree:
```
     1
   /   \
  3     2
       / \
      5   4
```

### Dry Run with second approch:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `root = 1`
   - We initialize an empty queue: `queue = []`
   - Add the root node `1` to the queue: `queue = [1]`

2. **Iteration 1:**
   - Poll node `1` from the queue (`current = 1`)
   - `queue = []`
   - **Current node:** `1`
     - Left child: `3`
     - Right child: `2`
   
   - **Step 1:** Swap the children of node `1`:
     - `temp = current.left` (which is `3`)
     - `current.left = current.right` → `current.left = 2`
     - `current.right = temp` → `current.right = 3`
     - After swapping, the tree now looks like:
     ```
            1
          /   \
          2     3
        / \
        5   4
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Add the children of node `1` to the queue:
     - Add `2` to the queue: `queue = [2]`
     - Add `3` to the queue: `queue = [2, 3]`

3. **Iteration 2:**
   - Poll node `2` from the queue (`current = 2`)
   - `queue = [3]`
   - **Current node:** `2`
     - Left child: `5`
     - Right child: `4`

   - **Step 1:** Swap the children of node `2`:
     - `temp = current.left` (which is `5`)
     - `current.left = current.right` → `current.left = 4`
     - `current.right = temp` → `current.right = 5`
     - After swapping, the tree now looks like:
     ```
            1
          /   \
          2     3
        / \
        4   5
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Add the children of node `2` to the queue:
     - Add `4` to the queue: `queue = [3, 4]`
     - Add `5` to the queue: `queue = [3, 4, 5]`

4. **Iteration 3:**
   - Poll node `3` from the queue (`current = 3`)
   - `queue = [4, 5]`
   - **Current node:** `3`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)
   
   - **Step 1:** Since there are no children, no swapping is needed.
   - **Step 2:** Nothing is added to the queue, so the queue remains: `queue = [4, 5]`

5. **Iteration 4:**
   - Poll node `4` from the queue (`current = 4`)
   - `queue = [5]`
   - **Current node:** `4`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)

   - **Step 1:** No swapping needed (no children).
   - **Step 2:** Nothing is added to the queue, so the queue remains: `queue = [5]`

6. **Iteration 5:**
   - Poll node `5` from the queue (`current = 5`)
   - `queue = []`
   - **Current node:** `5`
     - No children (both left and right are `null`)

   - **Step 1:** No swapping needed (no children).
   - **Step 2:** Nothing is added to the queue.

7. **Termination:**
   - The queue is now empty (`queue = []`), so the while loop terminates, and we return the root of the mirrored tree.

### Final Tree Structure (Mirrored):
```
      1
    /   \
    2     3
  / \
  4   5
```

### Recap of Process:
- We iteratively processed each node by swapping its left and right children.
- We used a queue to traverse the tree in a level-order fashion.
- After all nodes were processed, the original tree was mirrored.

This is how the iterative approach works using a queue (BFS) to mirror the binary tree.
