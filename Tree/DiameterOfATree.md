Here are the key clarifying questions you could ask in an interview before solving the **Diameter of a Binary Tree** problem:

1. **Clarify the definition of diameter**:  
   - "Is the diameter defined as the number of nodes or the number of edges between two leaf nodes?"

2. **Tree structure**:  
   - "Can the tree have just one node? What would the diameter be in that case?"
   - "Is the tree binary, or can it have more than two children per node?"

3. **Edge cases**:  
   - "Are there any specific edge cases I should consider, such as an empty tree or a skewed tree?"

4. **Input format**:  
   - "How is the tree provided as input? Is it as a TreeNode object, or in some other structure?"

5. **Output format**:  
   - "Should the result be the total number of nodes on the path, or should I return the number of edges?"

These questions will clarify the problem and help avoid misunderstandings during the interview.

To solve the problem of finding the diameter of a binary tree, we need to understand that the **diameter** of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaf nodes. This path **may or may not** pass through the root.

### Approach:
We can solve this problem using a recursive depth-first search (DFS). The key insight is that for each node, the diameter can either be:
1. The maximum diameter of its left or right subtrees (i.e., the longest path entirely within the left or right subtree).
2. The path that passes through the root, which would be the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees plus 1 (for the root node itself).

### Steps:
1. For each node, calculate the height of its left and right subtrees.
2. The diameter for that node is the maximum of:
   - The diameter of the left subtree.
   - The diameter of the right subtree.
   - The sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees plus 1 (for the path through the root).
3. Keep track of the maximum diameter encountered during the recursion.

### Recursive Function:
We can create a helper function to calculate both the height and diameter at the same time.

### Code Implementation (Java):

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class BinaryTreeDiameter {
    
    // To store the result of maximum diameter
    int maxDiameter = 0;
    
    public int diameter(TreeNode root) {
        calculateHeight(root);
        return maxDiameter;
    }
    
    // Helper function to calculate the height of the tree and update maxDiameter
    private int calculateHeight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = calculateHeight(node.left);
        int rightHeight = calculateHeight(node.right);
        
        // Update the diameter: max of (current diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight)
        maxDiameter = Math.max(maxDiameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        
        // Return the height of the current node
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- `calculateHeight()` recursively computes the height of each subtree. It also updates the `maxDiameter` at each node by comparing the current diameter with the maximum diameter seen so far.
- The diameter at each node is computed by adding the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree.
- The final diameter is stored in the `maxDiameter` variable.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: We visit each node exactly once to calculate the height and update the diameter.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(Height of the Tree)**: The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height can be O(N).

This approach ensures that we find the diameter of the binary tree efficiently within the given constraints.
